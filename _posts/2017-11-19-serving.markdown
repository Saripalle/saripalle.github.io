## Introduction

Before going into the intro, I want to give full credit to @guillaumegenthial for his tutorial. This demo was built based on his project.

This is an incomplete page, and in progress. 

I wanted to see if I can deploy my machine learning models on web (just like deploying flask server on internal networks). I have never encountered situations to deploy the model I built on servers outside of our networks. After a bit of searching, I found the demo by @guillaumegenthial very easy to understand, and decided to give it a try. It was easy to follow the tutorial, and below is my version for predicting the crop based on images.

To understand the process, I created a model to predict the crop type based on satellite images. I thought it was a cool project with a real use case. I also present the results ion larger dataset, previous work and code below.

Our goal is to build an API that will look like

{% include api_ner.html
    placeholder="#RespectMyAuthority"
    default_input="#RespectMyAuthority"
    default_output=" - - "
    header="Interact with the model!"
    url=""
%}
