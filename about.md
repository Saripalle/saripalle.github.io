I am a Research Scientist with ZOLOZ, where I work on advancing our biometric products using machine learning. I am passionate about biometrics and "AI for social good" - especially in the fields of agriculture and health industry and always looking for challenges in these fields.

I received my Masters and PhD from <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">University of Missouri - Kansas City</a> in Computer Engineering. My Masters research is in the domain of non-invasive human motion recognition, and my PhD research is related to ocular biometrics. I was also involved in some cool research projects including postmortem biometrics, deception detection and multi spectral biometrics. Checkout the projects page for more details.

I had a very different PhD path compared to traditional doctoral candidate, a great one at that. My PhD research project took a sudden turn in my second year. Our professor <a href="http://sce2.umkc.edu/csee/derakhshanir/Main.html">Dr. D</a> along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiasrush/">Toby Rush</a> decided to turn our research into a product giving birth to EyeVerify (now ZOLOZ). So, I worked towards my PhD with an intention to build an awesome product, that can benefit common people. After years of work and an awesome team, we built a secure easy to use software only biometric system that can run on any mobile device with a front facing camera. The company was acquired by Ant Financial in 2016 (an year after my graduation).
