<br>
I am a Research Scientist with ZOLOZ, where I work on advancing our biometric products using machine learning. I am passionate about biometrics and "AI for social good" - especially in the fields of agriculture and health industry and always looking for challenges in these fields.

I received my Masters and PhD from <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/"> <b University of Missouri - Kansas City</b></a> in Computer Engineering. My Masters research was in the
domain of non-invasive human motion recognition, and my PhD research is related to ocular biometrics. I was also involved in some cool research projects including postmortem biometrics, deception detection and multi spectral biometrics.

I did some research with the <a href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io">Machine Learning Group</a> on Natural Language Processing, and was one of the authors of a <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1057">paper</a> introducing a simple noising technique for data generation applied to the Grammar-Correction task. I invite you to test a <a href="https://crio.stanford.edu"><b>cool alternative to grammarly, named Crio</b></a>, being developed on top of this work.

I also did a project with the SLAC Machine Learning Group during Winter 17 on applying computer vision techniques for 3d cluster-splitting in ATLAS.

During my time at Stanford, I was also a TA for some graduate level classes in Machine Learning :
- <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</a> taught by Christopher Manning and Richard Socher for which I contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/cs224n-winter17-notes">lecture notes</a>.
- <a href="">CS234: Reinforcement Learning</a> taught by Emma Brunskill, for which I developed the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/assignment2/index.html">assignment on Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>, replicating DeepMind's DQN paper on Pong.
- <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu">CS229: Machine Learning</a> taught by Andrew Ng and Dan Boneh, for which I wrote the <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes13.pdf">lecture note on Linear Quadratic Regulation</a>.
- <a href="http://cs230.stanford.edu">CS230: Deep Learning</a>, taught by Andrew Ng and Kian Katanforoosh, that follows <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a>. With <a href="https://omoindrot.github.io">Olivier Moindrot</a>, we developed a starter code in Tensorflow for NLP and Computer Vision to help students bootstratp their projects.
